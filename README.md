# QuSpin-MBL-simulations
Simulating Many-body dynamics of 1D spin chains by QuSpin
- Studied and simulated the many-body dynamics of a single crystal of fluorapatite that can be mapped to the interactions in an ensemble of 1D spin chains. Simulation was done through QuSpin.
- The Hamiltonian used to study the spin chains is NMR-engineered. It involves terms of nn-interactions in addition to disordered fields along the z and x directions.
- Investigated and implemented the Eigenstate Entanglement Spectrum (EES) for different strengths of interaction and disorder to study the transition of the system from a many-body localized state to a thermalized one.
- Implemented a set of different metrics to quantify order in our system (Entanglement Entropy, Entanglement Spectrum Statistics (ESS), Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs)).
- Focused on OTOCs as itâ€™s accessible experimentally through NMR. Investigated the growth of OTOCs in different configurations to study the spread of correlation within the system.
- Compared results from the OTOCs simulations with the EES simulations; looked at the growth of the OTOCs in a many-body localized hamiltonian and its growth in a thermalized one.
